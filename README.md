# Rust Trap Base
*This project is an auto closing trap base*
_It is not intended as a best setup_
*_Note that the doors aren't hooked up in the images or diagram, to connect these please add a branch to the "OR SWITCH (OUTPUT)" and connect both doors to this. You will also need to provide more electricity to the OR SWITCH in order for this to work. This was designed for a 2x2 base_*
